# OpenGLBasicFramework

This application was based off of TheCherno's OpenGL series and then was expanded upon to add new features.

There are 5 different "Tests" for what the current application can achieve.

1. Changing the background color
2. Maneuver 2 repeated images around a space
3. Control a camera around a 3-D enviroment with the ability to change position as well as rotation
4. Can alter Point, Direction, and Spot Lights in an enviroment to visualize ambient, diffuse, and specular calculations within the shaders
5. Can visualize Depth, Stencil, and Blending in an enviroment
